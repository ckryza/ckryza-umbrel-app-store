  Dual Pool Mining Proxy (DPMP) is a Stratum v1 mining proxy that sits between
  miners and two upstream pools, allowing your miner(s) to mine to both pools
  simultaneously. It supports deterministic time-sliced dual-pool scheduling,
  safe job and share routing, and a NiceGUI-based web interface.
